\section{Company Profile and reflection} \label{company}
As part of AAUs project oriented stay at a company (POSC) the student is expected to deliver a company and project process related description as part of the project documentation. This chapter firstly includes a general description of Vestas as a company including its areas of work, organisational layout and culture. Secondly a description of the student's personal payoff from the work at Vestas is included, divided into three parts: Theoretical and practical, work-related and social. Finally suggestions to changes to POSC procedures are listed followed by a reflection on sharing of knowledge between Vestas and AAU.

My payoff from my project oriented stay at Vestas split into three main parts: The theoretical/practical payoff, the work-wise payoff and the social payoff.

Almost all of the theoretical gain that i have received
