\noindent This project documents the development of a state-space control model and controller for a floating wind turbine. A linear state-space model is constructed using the first principles modelling approach. An efficient model with three states is obtained by only including components which are relevant for capturing the fore-aft motion dynamics. An infinite horizon linear quadratic regulator with integral action was developed and tuned to achieve satisfactory performance with regards to both rotor speed tracking and fore-aft motion damping. The controller achieved superior performance in comparison to both the original full load controller (FLC) with no fore-aft damping and to the detuned FLC in the Vestas Turbine Simulator (VTS) environment.
