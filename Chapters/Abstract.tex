\noindent This project documents the development of a control model and controller for a Vestas floating wind turbine. A linear state-space model was constructed using the first principles modelling approach. An efficient model with three states was obtained by only including components which were relevant for capturing the fore-aft motion dynamics. An infinite horizon linear quadratic regulator with integral action was developed and tuned to achieve satisfactory performance with regards to both rotor speed tracking and fore-aft motion damping. The controller achieved superior performance in comparison to both the original full load controller (FLC) with no fore-aft damping and to the detuned FLC in the Vestas Turbine Simulator (VTS) environment. These results were achieved on the condition that the LQI controller was synthetically input the true states of the fore-aft position and velocity in stead of estimates derived from the noisy simulated sensor. The project has been carried out at the Vestas headquarters in the Loads and Control (LaC) department. Jesper Thomsen from LaC has provided extensive counselling and internal LaC software tools have furthermore been made available to reach the project goal.
