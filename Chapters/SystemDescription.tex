\section{System description} \label{sec:sys-descr}
This section is 
It is not of great importance which specific turbine is the subject of examination with regards to exploring and dealing with the floating control problem. But the specifications of the turbine determines the model parameters. Therefore this section is first and foremost dedicated to outlining the turbine specification and secondly to define the software environment which the system is derived from and evaluated upon.

The turbine examined in this project is the Vestas V164-8.0 (8 MW). Its operating ranges are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cut in: 4 m/s
	\item Nominal: 13 m/s
	\item Cut out: 25 m/s
	\item Survival: 50 m/s
\end{itemize}
The rotor diameter is 164 m

- Operating wind ranges
- Rotor specs
- Generator
- Tower specs



System description also contains information about the simulation environment e.g. the turbine is not subject to turbulence nor waves.

The project turbine is a variable-speed-variable-pitch type.

\noindent \textbf{About inducing a frequency on the rotor speed}\\
A frequency is induced on the rotor speed by applying a test sine wave on the generator speed reference in VTS 

%A custom set of DLCs are made by the SysIdFreqSweep tool. In each DLC the third line says something like this:
%
%\textit{"0.1 2 14 0 OverrideCSVParameter ProdCtrl Px\_TestSine\_GenSpdRef\_Period 100 -200 rho 1.225 time 0.01 1800 10 400"} \\
%here 
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item "OverrideCSVParameter" means that a CSV parameter should be overwritten with this DLC
%	\item "ProdCtrl" means that it's the "ProdCtrl" CSV file which contains the paramter which should be overwritten
%	\item "Px\_TestSine\_GenSpdRef\_Period 100" means that the "Px\_TestSine\_GenSpdRef\_Period" tag should be set to 100
%\end{itemize}. 
%Furthermore the simulation folder contains a file called "\_CtrlParamChanges.txt". In this files specific parameters can further be set to chosen values. In this file the following parameters are set:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Px\_TestSine\_GenSpdRef\_SelectType 	= 1
%	\item Px\_TestSine\_GenSpdRef\_Ampl			= 2.1 [rpm]
%\end{itemize}
%The first parameter sets the selected generator speed reference to be \textbf{added} to the controller-specified generator speed in stead of \textbf{overriding} it.
%
%In the second parameter 2.1 i is equivalent to 5\% of the average generator speed (in rad/s) which lies around 40-41 rad/s.
