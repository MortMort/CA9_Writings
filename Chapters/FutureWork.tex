\section{Future work} \label{sec:future}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Make a gain scheduling scheme for all of the FL region: 1. tune LQI weights for a range of operating points and interpolate between them to get continuous controller parameter functions. 2. Derive an inverse function of the non-linear pitch authority. 
	\item Make an estimator for the fore-aft position and velocity
\end{itemize}
