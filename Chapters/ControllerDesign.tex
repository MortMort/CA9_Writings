\section{Controller design} \label{sec:ctrl-design}
This chapter firstly presents basic LQR and LQI controller theory and secondly the derived controller. 
The main purpose of this chapter is firstly to present the basic LQR and LQI theory and secondly the derived LQI controller. Finally the LQI controller is analysed with respect to how the closed loop system poles moves when the LQI weights are changed.

\subsection{Linear-Quadratic Regulator} \label{sec:ctrl_lqr}
The Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in its \textit{infinite horizon} form is the preferred controller. It is chosen because the LQR tuning process of choosing weights to penalize state deviations is deemed more intuitive than defining pole locations in the \textit{pole placement method}. Furthermore an LQR controller guarantees 6 dB gain margin and 60 degree phase margin \cite{Doyle1978}. 

For a system
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ctrl_sys}
	\begin{split}
		\dot x &= A x + B u \\
		y &= Cx
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
the LQR controller is an optimal with respect to a relevant cost function such as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lqr_cost}
	J = \int_{0}^{\infty} \left(x^T Q x + u^T R u + 2x^T N u\right) dt
\end{equation}
where
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l r l }
		weight & $R$         & $ > 0$ (positive definite) and symmetric       \\
		weight & $Q$ and $N$ & $\ge 0$ (positive semi-definite) and symmetric
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\smallskip
The final term cross-term which punishes combinations of inputs and states is usually omitted by setting $ N = 0 $. The diagonal entries of $ R $ and $ Q $ are considered tuning parameters. The solution to the LQR control problem is the optimal control feedback which minimizes the cost function. The LQR controller is thus inherently a regulator meaning that it drives the system states to 0. For a system linearised at an operating point $ \{x_o, u_o\} $ the state and input deviations from the operating point replaces the actual states and inputs: $ \hat x = x-x_o $ and $ \hat u = u-u_o $. Given that the operating point is located at the reference the regulator property is obviously not unattractive. With $ N = 0 $ and states substituted with state deviations the final cost function becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lqr_cost_final}
	J = \int_{0}^{\infty} \left(\hat x^T Q \hat x + \hat u^T R \hat u\right) dt
\end{equation}
The optimal feedback gain can be shown to be: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lqr_K}
	K = -R^{-1} B^T P
\end{equation}
with P being the solution to the algebraic Ricatti equation:
\begin{equation}\label{lqr:ricatti}
	A^T P + P A - P B R^{-1} B^T P + Q = 0
\end{equation}
It is noted that proving \cref{eq:lqr_K} is deemed outside the scope of this report. This leaves $ Q $ and $ R $ to be tuned in such a manner that a satisfactory performance is achieved. For initial guesses \textit{Bryson's Rule} can be utilized. It states that a diagonal entry in $ Q $ or $ R $ for a corresponding state $ x_i $ or input $ u_i $ should be set as such:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bryson}
	\begin{split}
		Q_i = \dfrac{1}{Max(\hat x_i)^2} \\
		R_i = \dfrac{1}{Max(\hat u_i)^2}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $ Max(\hat x) $ is the largest tolerated value of $ \hat x $. While optimal performance is rarely achieved without further tuning Bryson's Rule gives a good starting point. In Matlab the \textit{lqr(A, B, Q, R, N)} function is used to get the controller gains $ K $.


\subsection{Linear-Quadratic Integrator} \label{sec:ctrl_lqi}
As described \cref{sec:comp_flc} the FLC controller is of the proportional-integrator (PI) type which ensures no generator speed steady state error due to integral action. The controller to be derived includes generator speed control and the regular LQR controller does not have integral action. Therefore the system is augmented with an integral state on the generator speed $ \dot x_i = \hat \omega $ leaving the extended state space system to be:
\begin{align} 
	\dot {\bar x} & = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\hat x} \\ \dot x_i \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A &0 \\ C_{iy} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \bar x + \begin{bmatrix} B_u \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  \hat u \\
	\hat y & = \begin{bmatrix} C & 0 \end{bmatrix} \bar x
\end{align}
where $ C_{iy} $ is defined such that the output to be integrated is picked out and $ \bar x $ is the deviation state vector extended with the integral state. %; in this case the generator speed.

A linear quadratic integrator (LQI) controller is obtained when the integrator-augmented system matrices are used to solve the LQR problem. The dimension of $ Q $ increases for every extra integrator state and thus extra weights are defined for these. 


\subsection{The controller} \label{sec:ctrl_thecontroller}
In the preceding sections the LQR and LQI controllers were explained and we are therefore ready to make the LQI controller. Firstly the FLC controller is removed from the system such that the input to the system is the pitch reference $ thRef $ in stead of the rotor speed reference $ wRef $. Stability and controllability are checked and the system is both stable and controllable. The \textit{lqr()} Matlab function is used with the integrator-augmented system. Bryson's Rule is used to define $ Q $ and $ R $ by defining maximum limits to the states and controllable inputs. A less intuitive weight is put on the integrator state. After a controller tuning process in VTS the resulting gains are:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lqi_K}
	K = \begin{bmatrix} -1.264 &  1.249 & -75.159 & -9.549 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
when the $ Q $ and $ R $ matrices are defined as such:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lqi_Q_and_R}
	\begin{split}
		Q = \begin{bmatrix}
			\dfrac{1}{max(p_y)^2}& 0 					& 0 															& 0 \cr
			0 					& \dfrac{1}{max(v_y)^2}	& 0 															& 0 \cr
			0 					& 0 					& \dfrac{1}{\left( max(\Omega) \cdot \frac{2 \pi}{60} \right)^2} & 0 \cr
			0 					& 0 					& 0 															& \dfrac{1}{(max(\Omega_i) \cdot \frac{2 \pi}{60})^2} \end{bmatrix} & = \begin{bmatrix}
			\dfrac{1}{5^2} 	&  	0 				&  0 										&  0 \cr
			0 				&  \dfrac{1}{1^2}	&  0 										&  0 \cr
			0 				&  0 				& \dfrac{1}{\left( 1 \cdot \frac{2 \pi}{60} \right)^2} 	&  0 \cr
			0 				&  0 				&  0 										&  \dfrac{1}{(5 \cdot \frac{2 \pi}{60})^2}
		\end{bmatrix} \\\\
		R = \begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{1}{\max(\theta_{ref})^2} \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{1}{5^2} \end{bmatrix}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
From $ Q $ and $ R $ it is observable that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the maximum allowed fore-aft position deviation is set to 5 m
	\item the maximum allowed fore-aft velocity deviation is set to 1 m/s
	\item the maximum allowed fore-aft rotor speed deviation is set to 1 rpm
	\item the rotor speed integration weight is set 5 times lower than the rotor speed
	\item the maximum allowed pitch angle actuation deviation is set to 5 deg
\end{itemize}
The maximum tolerated rotor speed is multiplied with $ 2 \pi $/$ 60 $ to translate the weight from rpm to rad/s which is the state unit. There is furthermore no intuitive explanation behind the choice of the integrator weight other than that it has yielded satisfactory results in the controller tuning process. Only light tuning was necessary from the initial guesses of maximum tolerable state and input values to achieve good performance. This highlights the usefulness of the LQR controller when a fitting linear model is used. Also perhaps importantly when the necessary system understanding has not been achieved such that pole placement can be done based on reasonable design considerations. Some system understanding can perhaps be achieved by considering the positions of system poles and zeros and thus a drawback of LQR might be that some understanding is lost when omitting this process.

\subsection{LQI controller analysis}
This section is dedicated to analysing how the LQI controller moves the system poles and changes the system behaviour when some weights of $ Q $ and $ R $ are changed. The poles of the open-loop uncontrolled system is plotted together with the closed-loop LQI controlled system. Each plot contains a change in one weight (e.g. via $ max(\Omega) $) with three variations of that weight to see how the poles move. The weights which are not changed are left at the tuned values presented in \cref{sec:ctrl_thecontroller}. 

\smallskip
In \cref{fig:pzmap_vy} the LQI $ Q $ weight on $ v_y $ is varied via $ 1/max(v_y)^2 $. The blue markers indicate the poles of the uncontrolled system. The frequency of the pole pair closest to the imaginary axis fit well with the structure eigenfrequency around 0.035 Hz. The high ratio between the imaginary and real part indicate a very low dampening of especially the uncontrolled system (blue markers). As expected when putting a greater constraint on the tower velocity the dampening is increased. It moves from 0.28 for $ max(vy) = 1 $ to 0.435 for $ max(vy) = 0.25 $. This happens because of the reduction of mainly the imaginary component of the dominating pole pair. The increased dampening is expected to lead to reduced oscillations of the turbine structure. This is also apparent when observing a step response as in \cref{fig:step_vy}. Here a reduction of the oscillations of $ p_y $ and $ v_y $ is observed but at the cost of a greater rotor tracking error. Furthermore, in the pole-zero diagram, the \textit{fastest} (most negative) pole on the real axis becomes even faster while the slowest becomes slower. The implications of how this affects the system response is harder to deduce. It is especially difficult to reason why the pole movement translates into the observed rotor speed response.

Furthermore one might wonder why the LQI controller does not simply make the dominating floating pole pair even faster with an even higher dampening. Here one should consider that a constraint on the actuator effort is still in place (in the form of $ max(\theta_{ref}) = 5 $) which limits the possibility of extensively reducing the fore-aft motion.

An increased constraint on the fore-aft velocity results in reduced fore-aft motion oscillations but greater rotor speed tracking error.}
	\label{fig:step_vy}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:pzmap_W_both} two plots are seen where the one in \cref{fig:pzmap_W_zoom} is zoomed in at the area indicated in the top right corner of \cref{fig:pzmap_W}. Here greater constraint is put on $ \Omega $ and in contrast to the $ v_y $ case the dominating pole pair of the floating structure moves in the opposite direction. This leads to lower dampening and stability of the floating movement due to the poles being closer to the imaginary axis. As expected when observing the step response in \cref{fig:step_W} the fore-aft oscillations are greater and last longer. Surprisingly the two poles located on the real axis move in the same direction as in \cref{fig:pzmap_vy} with the fastest pole becoming much faster and the slow pole becoming much slower. The effect as seen on the step response is that the rotor speed error is reduced. Giving a reasonable explanation for the movement of the poles on the real axis and how it yields better rotor speed tracking is difficult. With regards to the floating pole pair it is perhaps intuitive that if a much greater emphasis is put on limiting the rotor speed error it comes at the cost of less desirable fore-aft motion.

	\label{fig:step_W}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:pzmap_theta} the constraint on the rotor pitch angle actuation is varied from 1 deg to 5 deg with 5 deg being the original tuned parameter. With a tight constraint on the pitch angle of 1 deg the two poles which were located at the real axis have in stead become a slower pole pair as observed by the red poles at $ -0.1 \pm0.8 $. As the constraint is relieved from 1 to 5 deg the pole pair becomes faster with a lower dampening and ultimately turns into two faster real poles. The dominating pole pair's imaginary part is furthermore lowered as the constraint is relieved. The general tendency is that the system becomes both faster and more dampened. As expected allowing for a greater actuator effort leads to a better and faster system altogether which is also readily visible in the step response in \cref{fig:step_theta}. Both the magnitude of oscillations and settle time is reduces for both the tower movement and rotor speed error.
