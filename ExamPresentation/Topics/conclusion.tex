\begin{frame}{Conclusion}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A simple linear model which implemented a mass-spring damper approximation of the fore-aft motion was proven to sufficiently capture the the fore-aft motion dynamics.
		\item Deviation observed between linear model and VTS behaviour with fixed-bottom FLC
		\item LQI controller successfully implemented in VTS and achieved satisfactory rotor speed tracking while greatly damping fore-aft motion
		\item LQI controller parameter recalculation for other OPs partly or fully improves performance - if higher frequency components are assumed to be filtered out.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future work}{}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item VTS implementation required inputting real states of fore-aft position and velocity to controller
		\item An estimator fore-aft position and velocity
		\item Proper gain scheduling across full-load
	\end{itemize}
