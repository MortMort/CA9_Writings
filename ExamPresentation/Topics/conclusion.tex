\begin{frame}{Conclusion}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A simple linear model was proven to sufficiently capture the the fore-aft motion dynamics.
		\item A simple mass-spring-damper model successfully modelled the fore-aft motion
		\item The developed LQI controller developed achieved rotor speed tracking with zero steady state error and fore-aft motion damping
		\item In VTS implementation: Real states of position and velocity are fed to controller
		\item Deviation observed between linear model and VTS behaviour with fixed-bottom FLC
		\item LQI controller successfully implemented in VTS and achieved satisfactory rotor speed tracking while greatly damping fore-aft motion
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bryson's rule
			\item LQI had slightly higher actuator activity than detuned FLC
			\item Superior to fixed-bottom FLC and the detuned FLC
		\end{itemize}
	\item LQI controller parameters recalculation for other OPs partly or fully improves performance
	\end{itemize}
